# KMeans Clustering Unsupervised ML Algorithm
Using KMeans unsupervised clustering algorithm to identify optimal number of clusters to divide a dataset


In this notebook, we use a randomly generated dataset from make_blobs lirary. We create a KMeans clustering algorithm to create a model and fit our dataset to it to help determine its class. 
Using elbow method, We  then identify the ideal number of clusters by plotting the SSE (sum of squeared erros) for each cluster. The ideal number of cluster will have the SSE at the elbow of the plot , which shows any more clusters will be redundant.
